# Lightboxes

This is a collection of lightboxes I've designed. They're designed to fit [this shadow box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V5RR6D5) but any shadow box with a good depth and the right inner dimensions should work. 

I used [these lights](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1493DYH) and drilled a hole in the back of the box to pass the wire through.
